# Stellaris_Mass_Effect
A project to for fun and learning about Stellaris modding

The goal of the mod is to introduce each race in Mass Effect as a playable race inside canonical star systems.
And to have some unqiue technologies and events surround Mass Effect

Currently:

  - Majority of home systems have been created:
	- Asari home system
	- Turian home system
	- Salarian home system
	- Krogran home system
	- Quarian home system:
		- It isn't the system containing Rannoch, as they only get it in ME3 (If you so choose)
		- The home system is Raheel-Leyya, the location of the Flotilla at the time of Tali's loyalty mission
	- Geth home system:
		- The geth system is Tikkun, home to old Rannoch
  - Temporary images are being used in order to get the Mass Effect species playable
  - Origin for the Turian Unification War has been added, will polish up and make the writing/story better later
