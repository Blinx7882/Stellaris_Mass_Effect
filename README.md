# Stellaris_Mass_Effect
A project to for fun and learning about Stellaris modding. Not currently public on Steam just yet. It will be once temporary elements are removed.

The goal of the mod is to introduce each race in Mass Effect as a playable race inside canonical star systems.
And to have some unqiue technologies and events surround Mass Effect.

Currently:

  - Majority of home systems have been created
  - Temporary images are being used in order to get the Mass Effect species playable
