START_SCREEN_UNIFICATION_WAR:0 "The first colonies of our great empire grew distant. Our newly formed star faring empire was stretched thin in its ability to govern and administrate every colony across the stars.\nThe rulers of the distant colonies encouraged isolatation from our empire, and xenophobia ran rampant. Those that once originated from [GetHomeWorldName] no longer felt any love for the homeworld and our great empire. Tensions rose and war erupted.\n\nThe colonies fought for independance, and nearly prevailed. But the mighty forces of [GetHomeWorldName] squashed the insurrectionists and their colonies. The rebels were brought back into the fold of our empire.\n\nThe people of [GetHomeWorldName] now stood together stronger than ever before, unified under one banner.\n\nOur civilisation has endured the fires of civil war at its genesis. Nothing will stand in our way."
