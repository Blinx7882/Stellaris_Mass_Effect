This file contains everything that needs to be done/fixed

TODO:

- Figure out how to start with a habitat as a starting planet for the Quarians (might be hard/impossible with the new origins mechanic. Could be blocking habitat starts?)

- Adjust/fix orbital distances in each system so that some planets aren't so close to their respective suns (Do a check of each system)

- Add portraits for use of custom empires, so that Mass Effect empires can be created

- Add civics/traits that better reflect the Mass Effect empires lore wise

- Figure out if another crisis event can be added to the game, or if one can be adjusted

- Look at adding events to the game to better reflect Mass Effect
