# Stellaris_Mass_Effect
A project for fun and learning about Stellaris modding. Not currently public on Steam just yet. It will be once temporary elements are removed.

The goal of the mod is to introduce each race in Mass Effect as a playable race inside canonical star systems.
And to have some unqiue technologies and events surrounding Mass Effect.

Currently:

  - Majority of home systems have been created:
	- Asari home system
	- Turian home system
	- Salarian home system
	- Krogran home system
	- Quarian home system:
		- It isn't the system containing Rannoch, as they only get it in ME3 (If you so choose)
		- The home system is Raheel-Leyya, the location of the Flotilla at the time of Tali's loyalty mission
	- Geth home system:
		- The geth system is Tikkun, home to old Rannoch
  - Temporary images are being used in order to get the Mass Effect species playable
  - Origin for the Turian Unification War has been added, will polish up and make the writing/story better later
